Project Introduction
The use of nuclear fusion as a source of energy has been an idea since the dawn of the atomic science. However, fusion projects have been limited by the amount of resources required to run (often unsuccess) trials. As such, we propose the use of Theoretical Optimization Algorithm for Sustainable Technology (TOAST) to devise a Magneto-Inertial Fusion (MIF) device. Typical devices struggle to fuse the lighter elements that are optimal for energy production; our proposed MIF device creates extremely high temperatures (~100 million Kelvin) and pressures using solid-state electromagnets to accelerate Deuterium and Helium-3 plasma. The resulting self-sustaining compact toroid allows for plasma to fuse, releasing significant amounts of energy. We have implemented machine learning to find the minimum value of the toroidal radius, based upon the Grad-Shafranov Equation, alongside the magnetic flux, based on the theoretical pressure function (a product of the Beta and Alpha values). TOAST then uses these inputs to determine the magnetic flux profile, which can then be used to find a theoretical temperature and density based on the Lawson criteria. In order to formulate a computational model, we compared our algorithm using the relationships listed above to current experimental data. After computational accuracy was achieved, we found that a radius of 13.5762 m and alpha/beta values of 102.3877/22.9586 were optimal for reaching a temperature of 125.34 million kelvin and a density of 6.75*10^17 particles/m^3. This data can be implemented in future designs with experimental data to maximize energy yield.

Methodology:

For the Connecticut Science and Engineering Fair (CSEF), we developed a theoretical optimization tool, dubbed “TOAST” (Theoretical Optimization Algorithm for Sustainable Technology), that models Magneto-Inertial Fusion configurations. Drawing upon the Grad-Shafranov equation, we introduced a customizable pressure function J(ψ) = α·ψ - β·ψ² + sin(ψ) + 0.1·cos(ψ) to capture nuanced plasma behavior inside a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC). By varying α (linear pressure gradient), β (ratio of plasma to magnetic pressure), and the FRC radius, we simulated how changes in magnetic flux profiles affect plasma temperature and density under the Lawson Criterion. Through a combination of penalty-based optimization and advanced numerical methods (including ‘solve_bvp’ in Python), we discovered a sweet spot (α ≈ 102.4, β ≈ 22.9, radius ≈ 13.6 m) that balances temperature (reaching ~125 million Kelvin) and density without exceeding engineering limits (150 million Kelvin, 1022 particles/m³). The tool also explored the interplay of additional factors like electrical current and pulse duration, highlighting how these can be tuned to maximize net energy yield. This project offers a conceptual framework for future fusion research and underlines the potential of computational modeling in accelerating clean energy innovations.
	We then used a truncated Newton algorithm to optimize alpha, beta, radius, temperature, and density with the goals of having a medium alpha, low beta, and fairly high radius, which we enforced through penalties in our algorithm Figure 5 based on environmental conditions and goals. Our goal was to output the maximum possible temperature and density under 150 million Kelvin and 1022 particles/meter3, which could cause engineering issues. We ran 100 trials to optimize the radius and pressure function. We then correlated our results to the current intensity and pulse duration of the electromagnets, which form the magnetic field. The magnetic compression that the current and pulse duration parameters control adjust the parameters of the predetermined function, or alpha and beta for our theoretical function. The goal of the second optimization is to find the current and pulse durations best achieve the optimized alpha and beta values after the adjustment.
